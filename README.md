# linkedlist-library
A LinkedList implementation in JavaScript with Node.js including a sample use-case. Project contains a sample Tester class. The tester class allows for various unit tests to be called from the main entrypoint in the app for demonstration purposes. Ideally, a solution should use a fully featured unit-testing framework such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to build robust suites of tests with strong coverage to validate a project for production purposes.
